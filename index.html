It is generally enforced for a period of time. A few places have gone through prohibition, including:<ul><li>Canada (nationally, 1918-1920)</li><li>Faroe Islands (1907 – 1992)</li><li>Russian Empire and the Soviet Union (1914 – 1925)</li><li>Iceland (1915 – 1935)</li><li>Norway (1916 – 1927)</li><li>Hungarian Soviet Republic (1919-1919)</li><li>Finland (1919 – 1932)</li><li>USA (1920 -1930)</li></ul></div></div><div id="i2tp" class="cell gpd-clm"><div id="int7s" class="gpd-image-block"></div></div></div><div id="i8z3e" class="gdp-row gpd-grid"><div id="i6kez" class="cell gpd-clm"><h1 id="ink4f" class="gpd-header">What are the differences between Canada prohibition and America prohibition?</h1><div id="iq7k6" class="gpd-text">Prohibition in Canada was mostly a provincial matter, while in the United States it was a constitutional amendment that applied to the whole nation.<br>Prohibition in Canada was less strict and less enforced than in the United States. Many Canadians could still make alcohol or export legally ,depending of which province you can buy Alcohol .While many Americans bought or made alcohol illegally, or smuggled it from Canada or other countries.<br>Prohibition in Canada ended earlier and more gradually than in the United States. Most provinces repealed their prohibition laws in the 1920s, while the federal law was repealed in 1920. Prince Edward Island was the last province to end prohibition in 1948. Prohibition in the United States ended in 1933 with the repeal of the 18th Amendment.<br>The main cause of prohibition in Canada was the temperance movement, which was a social reform movement that aimed to reduce or eliminate the consumption of alcohol. The temperance movement believed that alcohol was the source of many social problems, such as poverty, crime, violence, and disease. The temperance movement also had connections to other causes, such as women’s rights, religious values, and wartime patriotism.<br>USA also had the temperance movement but also were the anti-immigrant sentiment, the Progressive movement, and the rural-urban divide.&nbsp;Some Americans associated alcohol with immigrants, especially Germans and Irish, and wanted to restrict their influence and culture.</div></div><div id="i2m7c" class="cell gpd-clm"><h1 id="ius5x" class="gpd-header">Whats rum running?</h1><div id="iexjg" class="gpd-text">The illegal business of smuggling alcoholic beverages where such transportation is forbidden by law is known as rum-running or bootlegging . The most common way of rum-running from Canada to America was by water, especially through the Detroit River, Lake St. Clair, and other waterways between Michigan and Ontario. However, there were interesting ways in which people in America hid or smuggled their contraband during the Prohibition era, such as:<ul><li>Bootleggers wore cow shoes to hide their tracks from their hidden breweries and decrease suspicion.</li><li>Bottles were hidden in legal products ranging from books to food.</li><li>Women bootleggers were common as there were laws for women to be searched by police, and the fashion at that time could hide bottles in coats and skirts. They even had lighter sentences than their male counterparts</li></ul></div></div><div id="iuxwa" class="cell gpd-clm"><div id="iyq74" class="gpd-image-block"></div></div></div><div id="idwbl" class="gdp-row gpd-grid"><div id="i551q" class="cell gpd-clm"><h1 id="ivszv" class="gpd-header">What does the prohibition era reflects on our present?</h1><div id="ikbgo" class="gpd-text">Prohibiting substances can lead to an increase in organized crime, such as bootleggers, and questionable substance quality. During the Prohibition era, when moonshine was first introduced, it was often like poison, and people were getting killed . Prohibition can also compound problems of stereotypes, such as black people being searched more or accused of having illegal substances much more than it should be proportionate to the country’s national population .<br>The question of what is a “bad” or “good” drug is also at issue. People can overdose on prescription drugs due to some having addictive natures like opioids or barbiturates, while psychedelic drugs can show improvement in psychiatric treatment from depression to chronic pain. It is hard for people to ask for help with addiction due to fear of going to jail for taking substances instead of receiving help through therapy and compassion.<br>The Prohibition era also had a significant impact on the criminal underworld. The ban on alcohol led to the rise of organized crime, which took advantage of the lucrative black market for alcohol. The War on Drugs, which began in the 1970s, has also been criticized for its role in increasing incarceration rates and perpetuating racial stereotypes.<br>Overall, the Prohibition era and the War on Drugs have had a lasting impact on our society, and the question of how to address substance abuse and addiction remains a complex issue.</div></div><div id="ijmx2" class="cell gpd-clm"><div class="gpd-image-block" id="iivyl"></div><img id="i642g" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhpalmbeach.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fprison.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=3fe75c1f697091562cb4e82fdf3e4eec32704771c7ec60f4f161555c40bc2adc&amp;ipo=images"></div></div>
